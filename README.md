# migrate from [github](https://github.com/iamshreeram) to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/iamshreeram)

After serious consideration of various factors, I have decided to move my daily works to to [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/iamshreeram). I will continue to push my new changes to gitlab. My existing repositories will be maintained in github. 

Below will be few of **Pros** in `gitlab` :

* Supporting Private Repository
* Fully Open Source
* Supports Continuous integration internally
* Flexible for Function as Service
* At last, It is not owned by `Microsoft`
